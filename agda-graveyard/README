It seems the model is inherently impredicative, so Agda can't work.

SemType : Set (n+1)
SemType = CVal → Set n
data StkOp : Set (n+1) where
  SO : CVal → Nat → SemType → StkOp

SemEff : Set (n+1)
SemEff = StkOp → Set n

We want to plug in V⟦ τ ⟧ as the SemType in SO.
So we want _∈V⟦ τ ⟧ : SemType

But the definition of _∈V⟦_⟧ uses _∈E[_/_],
which has to be in Set (n+1),
since its constructors quantify over SemTypes.
